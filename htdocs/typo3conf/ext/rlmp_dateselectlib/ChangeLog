	# Fixed a bug which appeared in IE and Opera: the year jumped to next year when selected the next month. Thanks to all those who send in the report and fix!

	I experienced some troubles with rlmp_dateselectlib if the render-charset is not the same as the local_lang charset - since the strings (month names...) are not converted.
	In my case the language is german, charset is utf-8. This resulted in weird characters with firefox and a javascript-error in ie.

	Modified version of the class with charset conversion.

	#	The $conf parameter at getInputButton now overrides the TS configuration like it should.
