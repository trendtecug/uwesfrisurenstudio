				<source>The Indexing Configuration records are used to set up how the indexing occurs, at which time and related to which part of the page tree.

				<source>&lt;b&gt;Records&lt;/b&gt; - You will be able to index records on a specified page from a specified database table. You can determine which fields from that record you want to index and how additional GET parameters should look like when linking to the search result.
&lt;b&gt;Files&lt;/b&gt; - Allows you to index a whole directory of files from the fileadmin/ folder. You can optionally specify how many levels of recursion you want.
&lt;b&gt;External URL&lt;/b&gt; - Allows you to index an external site and search it from your TYPO3 installation! You can specify how deep the crawler should go on that external URL.
&lt;b&gt;Page tree&lt;/b&gt; - Allows you to index the page tree using the cron script. This type will not be useful as a category for searching like the other types.
&lt;b&gt;Meta configuration&lt;/b&gt; - Points to a collection of other indexing configurations in which the search will be done. Cannot be used for cron-job based indexing.
&lt;b&gt;Custom&lt;/b&gt; - Other extensions might register custom types of configurations.</source>
			<target state="translated">&lt;b&gt;Records&lt;/ b&gt; - Sarete in grado di indicizzare i record in una pagina specificata da una tabella di database specificato. È possibile determinare quali campi da quel record che si desidera indicizzare e come ulteriori parametri GET dovrebbe essere simile a quando si collega al risultato della ricerca. 
&lt;b&gt;File&lt;/ b&gt; - Permette di indicizzare una intera directory di file dalla fileadmin / cartella. Facoltativamente, è possibile specificare il numero di livelli di ricorsione che si desidera. 
&lt;b&gt;URL esterno&lt;/ b&gt; - Permette di indicizzare un sito esterno e cercatela dalla vostra installazione di TYPO3! È possibile specificare la profondità del crawler dovrebbe andare su quella URL esterno. 
&lt;b&gt;Albero delle pagine&lt;/ b&gt; - Permette di indicizzare la pagina albero usando lo script cron. Questo tipo non sarà utile come categoria per la ricerca come gli altri tipi. 
&lt;b&gt;Meta configurazione&lt;/ b&gt; - segnala un insieme di altre configurazioni di indicizzazione con  in cui la ricerca sarà eseguita. Non può essere usato per l'indicizzazione cron-job based. 
&lt;b&gt;Personalizzato&lt;/ b&gt; - Altre estensioni potrebbero registrare i tipi di configurazioni personalizzate.</target></trans-unit>
