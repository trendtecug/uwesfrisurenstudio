				<source>In Firefox, when a set of contiguous table cells have been selected with a mouse movement or through the keyboard, clicking the "Merge cells" button merges the selected cells into a single cell.

In other browsers, when the cursor is positioned in a cell, clicking the "Merge cells" button prompts the user for the number of rows to the right and the number of columns down over which the cells should be merged. The set of contiguous cells so defined are then merged.</source>

				<source>Clicking the "Toggle borders" button makes the boundaries of all tables in the editing area visible or, if they are currently visible, the button being highlighted as active, hides these boundaries.
This applies only when editing content and has no effect when the element is rendered in the frontend.
This button may be configured so that it is activated when the element is opened for editing.</source>

Это влияет лишь на редактирование содержимого и не имеет никакого влияния на вывод содержимого на страницы сайта.
Кнопку можно настроить так, чтобы она становилась активной, если элемент открывается для редактирования.</target></trans-unit>
